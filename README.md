##### Step :two: :arrow_right: Install the Dependency files for the Tool

* Navigate to the Root folder of our Framework in the Terminal

* Here the Root folder will be `Brakeman-Comparison`

* Run the below command to navigate to the Root directory  
`cd Brakeman-Comparison`

## Running the tool in the localhost:
* We have to run the app.py file in the same terminal (We used to run `source setup.sh`)
* Use the following command to run the `app.py` in the localhost
  `python3 app.py`
* On the Browser, enter the following address
  `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
* Choose the Before Deployment and After Deployment files (in HTML) and click on upload
* It will take a few seconds to process
* A comparison report will be shown
* Compared report will be saved in the `templates` directory

## Git Ethics :sweat_smile:
⭐ Pull requests should be raised against the main Branch.

⭐ Once the PR is reviewed by the Reviewer, it will be merged into the main Branch.

⭐ While creating new branches checkout from the main branch. For tasks create a branch like JIRA-1234, where JIRA-2134 is the ticket ID in Jira.
